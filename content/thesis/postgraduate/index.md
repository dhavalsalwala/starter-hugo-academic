This thesis demonstrates the learning course of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
algorithms in a setup called Pursuit Evasion. Three multi-agent versions of the RL
algorithms have been explored in this research viz. Deep Q networks (DQN), Reinforce
and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C). The evaluation results reveal that Reinforce has a
better convergence rate in capturing the spatial correlation of the domain using deep
learning. A2C is a slow learner and could do better with parameter refinements. In the
experiments performed in this thesis, DQN did not perform well owing to the non-
stationarity of the domain.
