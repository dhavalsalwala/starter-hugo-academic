Currently, I am working in the position of Senior Research Engineer at IBM Research Ireland on a European Innovation Framework H2020 project on the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) sector.  

Previously, I have worked with Dr Edward Curry in Multimedia Complex Event Processing in the Smart Cities and Sustainable IT group at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at NUI Galway (NUIG). Here, I was researching in the field of real-time analytics and pattern detection for Multimedia Data Streams.

I am an experienced software professional with 7+ years of diversified industry experience. Led projects on developing ML solutions for multi-modal analytics using Computer Vision and Neuro Symbolic AI. I have worked on Computer Vision problems, multi-modal data analysis, Knowledge Graphs, Complex Event Processing and Deep Learning. Experienced in MLOps / AIOps processes including ML training / serving pipelines, CI/CD pipelines.

Passionate about building computer vision AI tools with research interests in Big Data and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
