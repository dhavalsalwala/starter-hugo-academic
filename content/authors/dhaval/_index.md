<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Before this, I worked as a Software Professional for over 5 years in the Finance Sector at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).
I have comprehensive experience in designing, developing and deploying E2E architecture for complex business process and data processing pipeline.
My comprehensive IT experience has given me a strong exposure to the functional and data architectures of critical operations. 
I was a chief developer to applications like Cash Payment System for Eurex Trading Platform T7 and Risk Management System for Citigroup.
