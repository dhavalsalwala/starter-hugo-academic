GNOSIS is a Multimodal Containerized framework that blends neural (DNNs) and symbolic (rules) models within the event-based paradigm to process IoMT multimodal streams utilising hybrid processing through video event knowledge graphs. GNOSIS combines deep learning and computer vision with real-time event processing capabilities within a microservice-based architecture for video stream processing and AI analytics in Complex Event Processing scenarios. GNOSIS simplifies the querying of streams and the deployment and optimisation of multiple pipelines.
